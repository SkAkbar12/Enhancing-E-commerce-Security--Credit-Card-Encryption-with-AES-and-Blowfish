# Enhancing E-commerce Security: Credit Card Encryption with AES and Blowfish
 An e-commerce website ensures secure credit card transactions by employing robust encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and Blowfish. These algorithms encode sensitive credit card information, ensuring it remains confidential during transmission and storage, bolstering customer trust and data security.
Clone the Repository: If the Django project is hosted on GitHub or any other version control system, clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Django requires Python to run. You can download Python from the official Python website. Make sure to install a version compatible with the Django project.

Install Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Django project to isolate its dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using virtualenv or venv:



# Using virtualenv
pip install virtualenv,
virtualenv myenv,
source myenv/bin/activate,  # for Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate,      # for Windows

# Using venv (Python 3.3+)
python -m venv myenv,
source myenv/bin/activate , # for Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate ,     # for Windows

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Database Setup: Configure your database settings in the settings.py file located in the project's directory. By default, Django uses SQLite, but you can configure it to use other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

Apply Migrations: Run the following command to apply migrations and create database tables:



python manage.py migrate

Create Superuser (Optional): If your project includes Django's authentication system or admin interface, you may want to create a superuser:

bash

python manage.py createsuperuser

Run the Development Server: Start the Django development server by running the following command:

bash

python manage.py runserver

Access the Application: Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/ to view your Django application.

Further Configuration: Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to configure additional settings, URLs, views, templates, static files, etc.
